# One particularly useful type of expression is a reference, which allows you to access
# values from other parts of your code. To access the ID of the security group resource,
# you are going to need to use a resource attribute reference, which uses the following
# syntax:
# <PROVIDER>_<TYPE>.<NAME>.<ATTRIBUTE>
# where PROVIDER is the name of the provider (e.g., aws), TYPE is the type of resource
# (e.g., security_group), NAME is the name of that resource (e.g., the security group is
# named "instance"), and ATTRIBUTE is either one of the arguments of that resource
# (e.g., name) or one of the attributes exported by the resource (you can find the list
# of available attributes in the documentation for each resource). The security group
# exports an attribute called id, so the expression to reference it will look like this:
# aws_security_group.instance.id
# You can use this security group ID in the vpc_security_group_ids argument of the
# aws_instance as follows:
#     data.aws_ami.amazon_linux.id
